<h1>The Best Movies According to Eli</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider-man</h3>
<p>This is my first favorite movie, because Toby Maguire plays an excellent role as Peter Parker and it is something that cannot be missed.</p>

<h3>The Amazing Spider-man</h3>
<p>This is my second favorite movie, because it has good CGI and even has different elements from the comics.</p>

<h3>Spider-man 3</h3>
<p>This is my third favorite movie of all time. This has to be one of the best movies ever made as the black Spider-man suit was undeniably cool. It had to have been made with Stan Lee.</p>
